## clexp's (Chris M Lewis) HSMA skills demo repo

This is mainly a reminder to me for how to do:
Simpy, pandas, regression, discrete event simulation, geographic modelling, Natural language processing, modeling optimisation, and other teachings from the Health Services Modelling Associates Course.

This is also somewhat a body of work to demonstrate 'work done'.

This covers dates April to November 2024. Dated work after this is really corrections, and missing files added to the repo.  
All questions open, please message me.
