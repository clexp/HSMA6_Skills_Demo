NOTE : in order to run the lecture examples and undertake the exercises in the DES sessions, you will need to use the des environment.

If you have already set this up as part of the final exercise in session 1D, you need do nothing other than activate the environment using :

conda activate des

or by selecting the des kernel from VSCode.

If you have not set up the environment as part of this earlier exercise, you will need to first import it from the supplied environment file.

Once you have downloaded the repository, navigate to the environment directory in your Ananconda prompt and type :

conda env create -f environment.yml
