# Notes on Named entity recognition

- text needs to be parsed
- parts of speach need to be tagged
- spacy uses a tranformer
- noun phrases are the bit we are looking for in NER
- regex is not suitable for this
- transformers are most suitable for this
- first was BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- before that ELMo
- transformers need attention
- this is a grid array of text versus text,
- there are encoders and decoders
- the encoders do feature extraction
