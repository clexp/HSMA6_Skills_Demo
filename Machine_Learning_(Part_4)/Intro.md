## Machine learning

There are many parts to this, the chief of what are supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.

Supevised learning is where the machine will learn from the human instruction, unsupervised is where it will teach itself, and reinforcement learning is where there is some sort of reward for correct results and it is arranged to prefer the reward.

Ideally we want our data ranges normalised and standardised. Machine learning models do better when sets of ranges are on very similar scales. Usually desicision trees and randome forests do not need scaling, linear regression and support vector machines use standardised input data. Neural networks use MinMax normalised input Data.
