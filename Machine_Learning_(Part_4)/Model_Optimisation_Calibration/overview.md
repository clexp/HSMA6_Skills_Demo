# Model optimisation and calibration

There were no notes here, just code.

## Missing data

This is a challenge for some techniques. Often you delete the rows. You could use smote or equivalent to add more data.

## imperative imputation

This is experimental

## one hot encoding and dichotomous columns, (like male and female)

## dichomotous columns, "male/female"

note about sex versus sexual identity
note about gender versus sex

## forward and backward feature selection

## Feature engineering

titanic data, derive families
titanic data, derive non family groups
binary flags, advanced feature extraction

## Splitting your data set

split into training, validation and testing.

## K-fold validation

- accuracy
- f1
- roc_auc
- macro precision
- macro recall

## Imbalanced Data

can 'balance' data for minority subsets (ethnicity/ protected characteristic)

## hyperparameter tuning

- Grid search
- Randomised Grid Search
- Optuna
- optimisation plot

## ensemble models

- voting models

## pipelines

?

## AUto ML

- flaml

## Model Calibration

One slide on sklearn calibration.
