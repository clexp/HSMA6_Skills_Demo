# this is about synthetic data

## VAE Variational Autoencoders

Encode the data into the latent space.  
Use the latent space to generate data that is not but looks like the original set

## GAN

Generative Adversarial Network

## SMOTE

Synethetic Minority Oversampling Technique

Find the under represented sample. Type it (? using a VAE? ), then generate similar, to reproportionately represent,
Graphically you can use KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbors)

Once generated, then remove the synthetic data that is too near the original
You can use imbalance learn for for this
