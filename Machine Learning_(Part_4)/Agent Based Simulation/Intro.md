### Agent based simulation

- Here we are looking at behaviours
- we consider 'emergent dynamics'
- the classic 'game of life' is an agent based simulation
- When you play this game you see patterns that were not programmed but are 'emergent'
- this sometimes happens in the real world, and is 'not explained by maths'
- These findings demonstrate emergent and self organising behaviour in simple systems
- this can be used to model
- the spread of disease
- individual behaviour effects
- adherence to prescribed medications
- Modelling decisions making under pressure
- this requires the use of reinforcement learning in a memory-effect
