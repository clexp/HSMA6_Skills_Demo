discussion for agent based simulation.

This is an attempt to consider modelling behaviours of humans who are engaged in drug seeking behaviours. These would be patience for whom there is a perceived need for medical treatment for which there is not a strong medical indication. Often the chief drug here is opiates or tramadol since they caused patience to feel high. Also benzodiazepines are a sort after drug. Equally gabapentin and pregabalin have a high street value.

I would want to build a model of patient behaviours of drug seeking behaviours in order to, predict and prevent drug abuse in which clinicians are in advertently complicit. The questions would be to see what the patterns are and see what is predictable. I would be interested to know if rehab works or who it will work for. I would also be interested to know what sort of, obstacles obtaining drugs are affective if any. The agent in the simulation would normally be any human seeking any drug. The page 8 agents may feign unwellness or once they have a prescription report missed or lost medication. They may try begging episodes at the pharmacy,obstacles obtaining drugs are affective if any.

They are likely to learn which clinicians are more lenient and which are stricter. They may well learn how to present disorder in a convincing way. This is in fact available online the environment would be the local community the pharmacist and the general practice motivation would be for pain for getting high for drug sale or for perceived pain. This model would be more appropriate as the environment will change overtime and as clinicians and pharmacies modify and increase their resistance to prescribing.
