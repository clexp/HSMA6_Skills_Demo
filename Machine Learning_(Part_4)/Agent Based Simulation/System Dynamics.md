System dynamics is a model than metal that method in which components are modelled and their interaction reveals behaviours. The fundamental principle is that structure determines behaviour.

A feature of system dynamics is causal leap diagrams. These can help us identify feedback loops which can be positive or negative causing a vicious or virtuous circle.
